# Changelog
The philosophy behind the version numbers is that of [SemVer](http://semver.org/), which means the versions are in the Major.Minor.Patch format.
A few highlights from the SemVer specification:

* Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.
* Bug fixes not affecting the API increment the patch version, backwards compatible API additions/changes increment the minor version, and backwards incompatible API changes increment the major version.
* Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version must not be modified. Any modifications must be released as a new version.
